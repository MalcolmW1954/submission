Getting and Cleaning Data-015 Course Project CODEBOOK file

Important note: The starting point for this project, and the associated
run_analysis.R program, is the README.TXT file supplied with the UCI HAR
Dataset.  This Codebook should be read in conjunction with that, and is not
intended to repeat information contained within that file.


The file Output.txt is a 180 x 8 table output of a tidy data frame.  It
contains an activity column, listing the six activities covered by the
analysis, and for each activity, the average measured performance by each
of 30 subjects on the six variables of interest.

It is therefore a "tidy" data set, with each activity/ subject/ observation
on its own row, and each variable in a separate column.

Activity: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING",
"STANDING", and "LAYING", as appropriate.

Subject: One of 1 to 30.

Variable 1: Mean of subject performances for "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" variable.

Variable 2: Mean of subject performances for "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" variable.

Variable 3: Mean of subject performances for  "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" variable.

Variable 4: Mean of subject performances for "tBodyAcc-std()-X" variable.

Variable 5: Mean of subject performances for "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" variable.

Variable 6: Mean of subject performances for "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" variable.
